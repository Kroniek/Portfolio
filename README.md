🌐 Website Design Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Below you'll find visual snapshots of websites I've designed using Wix and other no-code platforms. These tools allowed me to focus on aesthetic design, user experience, and responsive layouts—without writing code.

🛠️ What’s Included:
High-quality screenshots of my completed website projects

Sites built using platforms like Wix, Webflow, Canva Websites, and others

Emphasis on visual design, navigation, and mobile responsiveness

Customized layouts tailored for business, personal brands, and more

These projects demonstrate my skills in no-code website building, layout design, and creative presentation. Each site was thoughtfully crafted to meet client or personal goals using intuitive drag-and-drop tools.
